# NanoFlyer
The goal of this project was to test out skills I've learned on a conceptual level on actual hardware. I wanted practice using multiple executables communicating with one another (using ZMQ) in a linux environment, with some applications to controls and autonomous flight. I also wanted to play around with the Jetson nano

to do: add pinout & pics
